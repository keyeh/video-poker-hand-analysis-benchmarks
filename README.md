# Video Poker Hand Analysis Benchmarks
The goal of this project is to identify the fastest code for calculating the optimal discard strategy for a random video poker hand and payout table.

Please create an issue or pull request if you know of projects that I missed.


## Test System
MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017) running macOS 10.15.5
- CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7820HQ CPU @ 2.90GHz
- RAM: 16 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3

Using [Hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) for benchmarking:
`hyperfine --warmup 3`


# C++
Compiled using Xcode Version 11.6

```
  Time (mean ± σ):      2.988 s ±  0.021 s    [User: 2.914 s, System: 0.063 s]
  Range (min … max):    2.959 s …  3.019 s    10 runs
```
Appears to be exhaustive search of all 32 possible holds/discards.

# WebAssembly
## [v10.wasm](https://www.vpfree2.com/play_perfect/wasm/evaluate/v10.wasm) by Play Perfect
From: https://www.vpfree2.com/video-poker/hand-evaluator/
Tested with Chrome Version 84.0.4147.105
```
Evaluated 43,000 hands in approx. 10 seconds = 0.232558 ms per hand
```
We can interface with the webassembly analyzer by running code in the devtools console. The WASM analyzer is exposed in global scope as `window.game.wasm`. 


# Python
Tested using Python 2.7

  Time (mean ± σ):     228.4 ms ±   4.7 ms    [User: 439.6 ms, System: 219.6 ms]
  Range (min … max):   220.3 ms … 234.5 ms    13 runs
```
This is fast.
